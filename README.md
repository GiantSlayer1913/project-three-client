# Bucket List Application by Team Tomorrow

As a part of the curriculum of GA program, Michael Fisch, Timur Abuladze and Iryna Betancourt partnered up to architect, design, and collaboratively build an API of their own design of a bucket list aplication.

## About this Application

This is a simple bucket list application that lets users create, view, update and delete their bucketlist items.

## User Stories

- As an unregistered user, I want to be able to sign up for an account with my credentials, so that I can sign in.
- As a registered user, I want to see a message confirming that my account was created successfully, so that I can sign in with my credentials.
- As a registered user, I want to sign in with my account credentials at any time, so that I can create, update, view or delete my bucket list items.
- As a signed in user, I want to see a confirmation showing that Iâ€™m signed in.
- As a signed in user, I want to be able to sign out of my account at any time.
- As a signed in user, I want to see a confirmation showing that I created my bucket list successfully.
- As a registered user, I want to see all my bucket list items.

## Wireframes

Created at the first stages of the preparartion for the project, the wireframes came out to be quite different from the built application.

## Planning, Process and Problem-solving Strategy

In the beginning of our project planning we considered a number of options
for our wireframes and user stories. We discussed the design/look for our app
and what would be the relevant features of a bucket list for a potential user.
The latter would not be possible without building a backend structure condusive
to our client side. We concluded that our backend would be built with MongoDB,
Mongoose and Express. Throughout the process of our work, we always considered
our options before moving onto the next stage of our build, whether it was a
small CSS issue or a larger question regarding our app functionality.
